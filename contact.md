## Looking for Collaborators

I’m currently exploring how research, art, and daily life can be woven together—still learning, still adjusting.  
I’m always looking for people who might be interested in sharing parts of this journey or collaborating in small or big ways.  
If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you.

## Argentine Tango Appearance Requests

I welcome invitations for Argentine Tango performances.  
Depending on the nature and purpose of the event, I am generally available with only actual expenses covered (e.g., transportation).

Each request is carefully considered.  
Please feel free to share the details of your project or event.
