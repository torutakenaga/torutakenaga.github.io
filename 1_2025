# Portrait Project 2025 – Call for Participation  
Invitation to collaborate on a portrait creation project

## Overview

A photograph can capture not only appearance,  
but also presence, emotion, and intention that words often fail to express.

This portrait project invites individuals who are deeply engaged in expression, movement, or creation,  
to collaborate on portraits that serve as shared works—not services, but moments of mutual creation.

## Application Period: 2025 (First Term)

- Open throughout 2025  
- Selection-based: I will review all submissions and contact those who align with the intent of this project  
- Depending on the number of applications, the call may close earlier than scheduled

## Who This Is For

- Individuals committed to expression, physicality, or creative practice  
- Those who wish to leave a trace of who they are, at this moment  
- Those open to dialogue and collaborative creation

All genres, backgrounds, and levels of experience are welcome.  
No prior experience in portrait sessions is necessary.

## Session Details

- Duration: approx. 1–2 hours (in or near Tokyo)  
- Delivery: edited JPEGs (number of images to be discussed)  
- Delivery time: 1–2 weeks after the session  
- Location: outdoor or studio (to be decided through consultation)

## Cost

There is no fee for the session itself.  
However, I kindly ask that you cover any actual expenses involved:

## Final Note

This is not a job, nor a service.  
It is a space to create something together—quietly, thoughtfully, and intentionally.

If this resonates with you, I look forward to hearing from you.
