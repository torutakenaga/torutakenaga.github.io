## ğŸ“ˆ Philosophy

I approach investment like a scientific discipline â€” observing patterns, testing ideas, and refining methods. Itâ€™s not just about financial return, but cultivating focus and resilience.

## ğŸ›  Focus Areas

- Using Python-based bots to simulate trades
- Practicing small-scale trading on Japanese markets
- Logging hypotheses and refining decision processes

> *Money management, like data analysis or tango, reveals who you are â€” under pressure, in uncertainty, and over time.*
