# Lab

*Where I explore structure, data, and meaning — through viruses, models, and code.*

---

## Current Focus
- Under constraction

---

## Tools & Pipelines

### Data Science & Automation

- **Python scripts** for automating bioinformatics workflows  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for in silico experimentation and reproducible research  
- **GitHub repositories** (selectively shared) for pipeline transparency  
- **Command-line tools** integrated via shell scripting and Python wrappers  

---

## Approach

I combine wet-lab background with computational modeling to investigate viral behavior, protein structures, and data-driven insights — with the goal of building tools and understanding that bridge research and reproducibility.
