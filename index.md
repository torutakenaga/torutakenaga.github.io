# Toru Takenaga

Welcome to my site â€” a place where I share ongoing work across research, movement, and creative practice.

I explore questions in infectious diseases and structural biology, while also engaging with tango and kendo as ways of deepening physical and inner awareness.

You can find more about me [here](about.md), or browse projects [here](projects.md).
