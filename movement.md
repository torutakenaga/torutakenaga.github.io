## Bandoneon

The bandoneon is both an instrument and a discipline. Practicing it deepens my understanding of flow and breath.

### Tools

- [Sound samples](assets/sounds/) – Open/Close bellows demo

### Practice Tips
- Start with open-only practice
- Map finger memory before rhythm

> *Movement is not just action — it is how I perceive, relate, and shape the space around me.*
