# About

I’m a researcher with a background in infectious diseases, currently exploring dry analysis and structural biology to better understand viruses.

Outside of research, I practice tango and kendo — ways for me to stay present, aware, and connected.

Rather than defining myself by one title, I try to follow quiet questions and bring care into what I do.

This site is a small place to share that ongoing journey.
