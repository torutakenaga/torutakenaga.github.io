# About

*Doing what I love, hoping it helps.*

---

I’m a researcher with a background in infectious diseases, exploring how science, movement, and tools can quietly serve both personal curiosity and others' well-being.

From modeling viruses to refining tango steps and building trading bots, I follow what I’m drawn to — with the hope that it becomes helpful to someone else, somewhere.

Rather than aiming high, I try to stay steady and sincere in what I do.
