# About

I’m a researcher with a background in infectious diseases, currently focusing on dry analysis and structural biology as ways to better understand viruses.

Outside of research, I practice tango and kendo — quiet disciplines that help me stay present, aware, and connected.

Rather than defining myself by a single title, I try to follow quiet questions and bring care to whatever I work on.

This site is a small space to share that ongoing process.
