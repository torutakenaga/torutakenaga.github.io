# About

*Doing what I love, hoping it helps.*

---

I’m a researcher with a background in infectious diseases. My work explores how science, movement, and practical tools can quietly support both personal curiosity and collective well-being.

From modeling viruses and building trading bots to refining tango steps and practicing the bandoneon, I follow what draws me — with the hope it may be useful to someone, somewhere.

I try to stay steady and sincere in what I do.
