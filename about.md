# About

Toru Takenaga is someone exploring how science, movement, and daily life come together. Based in Japan, his background is in infectious disease and vaccine research, but he also devotes himself to dance and martial arts—tango, kendo, and the art of using his body’s weight and energy.

Since 2015, he’s been involved in the tango community, performing in cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Seoul, and collaborating with the KANSAI Tango Orquesta. His kendo journey began in 1998, and he has trained and taught internationally, now holding a 6th dan.

This site is a place for recording these ongoing experiments—some scientific, some artistic, some just part of living—and sharing them as they grow.
