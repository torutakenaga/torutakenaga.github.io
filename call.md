## Portrait Project 2025 – Application Open

A portrait is more than an image; it is a trace of presence, intention, and emotion.

The Portrait Project invites individuals deeply engaged in expression, movement, or creation to take part in a shared photographic process.

This is not a service but a creative collaboration. Selected participants will be contacted after review.

* Period: Open throughout 2025
* Location: Tokyo area (outdoor or studio sessions)
* Cost: No fee for the session itself; actual expenses only (transportation, location rental, if needed)
* Format: Selection-based — not first-come, first-served
